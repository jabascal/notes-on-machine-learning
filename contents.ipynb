There are great books that introduce the theory of ML and statistical learning [1]-[3]. In the case of examples, there is also a large number of sites and blogs. Many blogs are a great sources of implementations but in many cases the mathematical descriptions and links between theory and examples are missing.    \n","\n","This repository gathers the theory and examples from the course in Statistical Learning by T Hastie and R Tibshirani from Stanford University ([online course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning)), several books on statistical learning and machine learning [1]-[3] and a diverse source of examples based on different sources ([Scikit-Learn Machine Learning in Python](https://scikit-learn.org/stable), examples in R from the Statistical Learning course, among others). Examples are provided using google colab cloud services. \n","\n","[1] Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.
